# Mind Matters

[Deployed Site](https://alpaca-mybags.github.io/mindMatters/)

Mind Matters is a web application designed to make meditation and mindfulness practices more accessible to those who may be struggling with anxiety, depression, or just looking for a way to start their journey to self-care. It offers a wide range of guided meditations, exercises, and information for the user, while walking them through each step.

This project's intention was to practice fetching from public APIs - we use the chosen mood, video type, and the optional journal entry to search for an appropriate video to recommend for the user, using YouTube Data API.
